# About
My goal is to migrate from [my old webpage](http://web.uni-corvinus.hu/magyarkuti/) to here.
The reason is that the old links are out of service and the page is more than out fashioned.
This page is seriously *under construction*. 
See my [my wiki pages](http://146.110.110.35/mediawiki/index.php/Main_Page) and my old webpage, if you are still interested.
You can find some information on the page of my [deperatment](http://web.uni-corvinus.hu/math/) and perhaps [here](https://www.uni-corvinus.hu/fooldal/egyetemunkrol/tanszekek/matematika-tanszek/).

# Currently running projects
* Linear algebra book for my first year students. See [https://magyarkuti.github.io/linearalgebra/](https://magyarkuti.github.io/linearalgebra/)
* Teaching at fall semester
** Linear algebra, see above
** Calculus paractice class
** Auction theory [https:/doi.org/10.14267/cb.2018k02](DOI:10.14267/cb.2018k02)
** Functional Analysis
I am a bit frightened, perhaps I survive the fall, but I am not sure, today :)
