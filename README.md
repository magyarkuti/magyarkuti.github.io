My goal is to migrate from [my old webpage](http://web.uni-corvinus.hu/magyarkuti/) to here.
The reason is that the old links are out of service and the page is more than out fashioned.
This page is seriously *under construction*. 
See my [my wiki pages](http://146.110.110.35/mediawiki/index.php/Main_Page) and my old webpage, if you are still interested.
You can find some information on the page of my [deperatment](http://web.uni-corvinus.hu/math/) and perhaps [here](https://www.uni-corvinus.hu/fooldal/egyetemunkrol/tanszekek/matematika-tanszek/).
