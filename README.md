### Flashback
$$e^{i\varphi}=\cos\varphi + i\sin\varphi\quad\forall \varphi\in\mathbb{C}.$$ 
It is so beutifull. 
Thus we can write real mathematics using

syntax.

### About
My goal is to migrate from [my old webpage](http://web.uni-corvinus.hu/magyarkuti/) to here.
The reason is that the old links are out of service and the page is more than out fashioned.
This page is seriously *under construction*. 
See my [my wiki pages](http://146.110.110.35/mediawiki/index.php/Main_Page) and my old webpage, if you are still interested.
You can find some information on the page of my [Department](http://web.uni-corvinus.hu/math/) and perhaps [here](https://www.uni-corvinus.hu/fooldal/egyetemunkrol/tanszekek/matematika-tanszek/).
These pages will talk Hungarian earlier or later mainly if my feeling is that the potential readers are Hungarian students. 
If you are stil still interested but the language of the [front for alians of Mars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Martians_(scientists)) is not your native language, forgive me or contact me. I prefer to contact.

### Running projects
- Linear algebra book for my first year students. See [https://magyarkuti.github.io/linearalgebra/](https://magyarkuti.github.io/linearalgebra/).
- Teaching at fall semester of 2020
  - [Algebra 1.](https://magyarkuti.github.io/algebra-1/)
  - Calculus paractice class,
  - Auction theory [DOI:10.14267/cb.2018k02](http://unipub.lib.uni-corvinus.hu/3651/),
  - Functional Analysis.
- Associate editor of [Pure Mathematics and Application](https://content.sciendo.com/configurable/contentpage/journals$002fpuma$002fpuma-overview.xml?tab_body=overview).

I am a bit frightened for my next semester schedule. Perhaps I survive the fall, but I am not sure, today. ðŸ˜„
The time and the venue of my classes can be found in my [office calendar](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/embed?src=q3p3rt597a1cdvf2ulafbdpbio%40group.calendar.google.com&ctz=Europe%2FBudapest).
