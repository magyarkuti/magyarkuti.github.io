### Flashback
$$e^{i\varphi}=\cos\varphi + i\sin\varphi\quad\forall \varphi\in\mathbb{C}.$$ 
It is so beutifull. 
Thus we can write real mathematics using

syntax.

### About
My goal is to migrate from [my old webpage](http://web.uni-corvinus.hu/magyarkuti/) to here.
The reason is that the old links are out of service and the page is more than out fashioned.
This page is seriously *under construction*. 
See my [my wiki pages](http://146.110.110.35/mediawiki/index.php/Main_Page) and my old webpage, if you are still interested.
You can find some information on the page of my [Department](http://web.uni-corvinus.hu/math/) and perhaps [here](https://www.uni-corvinus.hu/fooldal/egyetemunkrol/tanszekek/matematika-tanszek/).

Earlier or later when my feeling is that the potential readers are Hungarian students these pages switch to Hungarian.
If you are stil still interested but the language of the [front for alians of Mars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Martians_(scientists)) is not your native language, forgive me or contact me. I prefer to contact.

### Running projects
- Linear algebra book for my first year students. See [https://magyarkuti.github.io/linearalgebra/](https://magyarkuti.github.io/linearalgebra/).
- Teaching at fall semester of 2022
  - [Algebra 1.](https://magyarkuti.github.io/algebra-1/)
  - Linear Algebra,
  - Functional Analysis.
  - Associate editor of [Pure Mathematics and Application](https://sciendo.com/journal/PUMA).
